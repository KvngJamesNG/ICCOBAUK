                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            The ICCOBAUK family has received an inspiring boost ahead of the 2025 Convention, as the Worldwide President of ICCOBAUK has made a generous personal contribution to support the event. This act of leadership and generosity not only strengthens the financial foundation of the convention but also sets a shining example of commitment to the mission and values of our alumni community.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            The 2025 Convention is shaping up to be one of the most important gatherings in recent years, bringing together old boys from across the globe to reconnect, share ideas, and chart the way forward for the continued growth of Immaculate Conception College. With the President’s support, the organizing committee is better positioned to deliver an unforgettable experience that reflects the unity and spirit of ICC.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            Speaking on the donation, members of the planning team expressed deep appreciation, noting that the President’s gesture demonstrates a heartfelt dedication to ICCOBAUK’s global vision. The funds will go directly toward ensuring a well-organized event, covering key areas such as logistics, welfare, and program excellence.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            More importantly, this contribution highlights the true essence of ICCOBAUK—brotherhood, service, and giving back. The Worldwide President has long been a strong advocate of alumni involvement, encouraging members at all levels to play an active role in supporting the school, the association, and each other.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            As the countdown to the 2025 Convention continues, this act of generosity has ignited fresh enthusiasm among members and inspired many to step forward in their own ways—whether through financial support, volunteering, or simply showing up in numbers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            The convention is more than an event; it is a statement of solidarity, a celebration of shared heritage, and a reaffirmation of our collective responsibility to keep the ICC legacy alive for future generations. With the Worldwide President leading by example, ICCOBAUK is poised for a memorable 2025 Convention.

                                    If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks.

                                    When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.
